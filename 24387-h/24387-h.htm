<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h2>

<p>The Community Cook Book is a collection of recipes chosen from many
hundreds that may well be considered representative of the best to be
found in any of the more intelligent and progressive of American
Communities in which a part of the population make occasional visits to
all parts of the country from which they bring back choice recipes to
contribute to the neighborhood fund. Added to this, that constant change
and interchange of a part of the population, and if the best recipes of
such a section be carefully selected and classified, then in a real
American Community's Cook Book, such as this, we have one of the most
valuable practical cook books in the world.</p>

<p>In presenting this cook book, the compilers were guided by the fact that
what each housekeeper needs, is not so much a great variety of ways, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>a few successful ways of preparing each article of food.</p>

</p>

<h4>BAKING POWDER BISCUITS.</h4>

salt, two tablespoonfuls lard, a little sugar if desired, one-half cup
milk or water, milk preferred. Mix flour, salt, sugar and baking powder
well with fork; add milk. When well mixed, drop in small quantities onto
buttered pans. Bake eight minutes in moderate oven.</p>

<h4>BAKING POWDER BISCUITS.</h4>

<h4>CORN GEMS.</h4>

<p>Two eggs, one-half cup white flour, one cup milk, one cup corn flour,

water, stir in enough flour to make a very stiff dough. Knead well,
shaping into a ball. Make two cuts on top about one-quarter inch deep.
Place in a pan of tepid water until it swells and floats. When very
light put into a bowl containing one-half cup salted water, stir in
enough flour to make a stiff dough. Let stand in a temperature of 68 or
70 degrees F. until light. Shape into loaf, let lighten again and bake.</p>

<h4>GRAHAM BREAD.</h4>

one tablespoonful sugar, one teaspoonful salt. When nearly cold, add
one-fourth cake of yeast, dissolved in one-half a cup of lukewarm water,
add flour stiff enough to knead. Knead until smooth and elastic, cover,
and let rise until morning, then shape into loaves, let rise again, bake
from forty to fifty minutes; rolls from fifteen to twenty minutes.</p>

<h4>MUFFINS.</h4>

<p>One egg, one-half cup sugar, two cups flour, two heaping teaspoonfuls
baking powder, three-fourths cup milk, salt. Mix egg with sugar. Sift

two tablespoonfuls butter, one egg, one yeast cake dissolved in
one-fourth cup lukewarm water. Mix dry ingredients and butter in the hot
milk; when slightly cool, add flour enough to make a drop batter, beat
well, add the yolk of egg, then the white beaten until stiff, and lastly
the dissolved yeast cake, beat hard. Then add flour enough for a soft
dough that you can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> handle. Turn on a well-floured board and knead until
covered with blisters, turn into a well-buttered bowl. Cover and place

<h4>POTATO ROLLS.</h4>

<p>Two cups hot mashed potatoes (four cups of sliced potatoes make about
two cups of mashed potatoes), one scant cup lard, two tablespoonfuls of
sugar, two teaspoonfuls salt, three well-beaten eggs. Mix all well
together and have it lukewarm, then add one-half cake of yeast, which
has been soaked in a cup of lukewarm water for twenty minutes. Let rise
two hours in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> warm place; work up (not too stiff) with flour; rise
again. When very light, roll thin on a biscuit-board, cut with a cutter,

<h4>CORN MEAL MUSH.</h4>

<p>Allow one pint of meal and one teaspoonful of salt to a quart of water.
Sprinkle meal gradually into boiling salted water, stirring all the
time. Boil rapidly for a few minutes, then let simmer for a long time.
Very palatable served with milk; some people like it with butter and
pepper. For fried mush let it get cold, then cut in slices, dip in flour
and fry in suet until brown.</p>

<h4>HOMINY.</h4>

<p>This is very good when well cooked, and may be simply boiled until done
in salted water, and served with pepper and butter. It is good fried
like mush.</p>

<h4>MACARONI WITH CHEESE.</h4>

<p>After boiling macaroni in salted water until soft, sprinkle with grated
cheese; repeat, pour over a sauce made of butter, flour, salt and
scalded milk; cover with bread crumbs and bake until brown.</p>

<h4>RICE.</h4>

<p>Rice has been cultivated from time immemorial. While not so valuable a
food as some of the other cereals, it forms the larger part of the diet
of people in the tropics and in semi-tropical countries, and is used
extensively in other places. It is eaten by more human beings than any
other cereal; is not equal to wheat as a brain food, but worthy of the
high place it holds in the estimation of mankind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be simply boiled and served as a vegetable, with pepper and
butter, or served with sugar and cream. It is good cooked in milk. Is
baked like macaroni with cheese, and cooked in various ways in
combination with meat or vegetables.</p>

<h4>BOILED RICE.</h4>

<p>One of the quickest ways of preparing rice is to fill a large kettle
with water, allow it to come to a boil; when bubbling vigorously throw
in two cups of rice and boil hard twenty-five minutes. Empty into a
colander and dash under cold water, which will separate the grains.
Season with pepper and salt, heap lightly on a dish and put a lump of
butter on top.</p>

<h4>ROLLED OATS.</h4>

<p>None of the breakfast foods which are so much used are so wholesome as a
simple dish of rolled oats or the old-fashioned oatmeal. Served with or
without cream and sugar, these are to be highly recommended to persons
who are compelled to live indoors a great deal, and are generally
relished by those who lead an outdoor life. Although rolled oats is
supposed to be a dish quickly prepared, it is better, like oatmeal, for
being cooked a long time, and baked for two hours, after being boiled a
few minutes, it is very palatable and nutritious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="SALADS" id="SALADS"></a>SALADS</h2>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">"Salads and eggs and lighter fare."</span><br />
</p>

<p>More progressive Americans now understand the value of the salad, and in
this way use many vegetables, fish and meats that heretofore have not
been extensively used for that purpose. There is room for much
interesting experimenting in the making of salads. Almost endless
variety may be had by ingenious mixing and combining of suitable
ingredients. Used sparingly, they give a zest to the plainest meal, and
the olive oil which is used so frequently in the preparation of salads
is of immense value in promoting health.</p>

<p>The greens used in making salad, lettuce, dandelion and water cress
should always be most carefully washed, and served only when fresh,
crisp and cold. Many canned vegetables and left-overs may be used in
salad, which would not be nearly so appetizing prepared in any other
way.</p>

<h4>ASPARAGUS SALAD.</h4>

<p>Use either fresh or canned asparagus. If fresh, of course it should be
cooked in the usual way and allowed to cool. Only very tender asparagus
is suitable for salad. Cut green or red peppers into rings, put four
stalks in each ring. Place these bundles on lettuce leaves and serve
with usual French dressing. A little pat of Philadelphia cream cheese
may be put on edge of each plate.</p>

<h4>BEET RELISH.</h4>

<p>One quart chopped beets, one quart chopped cabbage, one cup ground
horseradish, one cup brown sugar, salt and pepper to taste. Pour over
enough vinegar to moisten well about three cups. Heat and seal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

tablespoonfuls olive oil, one-half teaspoonful onion juice, one
tablespoonful vinegar. Mix in order slowly. One spoonful lemon juice may
be used in place of onion juice.</p>

<h4>FRUIT SALAD.</h4>

<p>Bananas sliced lengthwise in quarters; over this put pineapple in cubes.
Boil the pineapple a few minutes, to make it more tender. Then large
strawberries and English walnuts. Over it put a spoonful of mayonnaise.
Make the mayonnaise as you would a filling for lemon pie, with two
lemons. Add whipped cream to it before serving.</p>

<h4>HOT SLAW.</h4>

<p>Chop or slice one medium-sized cabbage; put in boiling water, well
covered; boil fifteen minutes, drain off all water and add a dressing
made as follows: Half teacup vinegar, two-thirds as much sugar, salt,
pepper, one-half teaspoonful mustard, one tablespoonful butter or olive
oil. When this is boiling hot add one teacup cream and one egg, stirred
together; mix thoroughly and immediately with the cabbage. Cook a
moment. Serve hot.</p>

<h4>LETTUCE SALAD.</h4>

mustard and sugar together; add to it the beaten eggs, sugar and butter;
then add vinegar and water, and cook over slow fire, stirring all the
time. Thin with cream when ready to use, and add celery seed if desired.
One-half of this can be made at one time.</p>

<h2><a name="MEAT" id="MEAT"></a>MEAT</h2>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">"Meat was made for mouths."</span><br />
</p>

<p>While it is undoubtedly true that raw meat is, as a rule, more easily
digested than cooked, our present state of civilization demands that it
be cooked, and we can only comply with the demand, preparing the food in
question so that it may be not only attractive to the eye, but in a
manner that will render it pleasing to the taste and readily
assimilated. Cooking softens the tissues, making the act of eating more
enjoyable, and also destroys parasitic growths.</p>

<p>To boil meat when broth is not desired, plunge into boiling water. The
water should be allowed to boil for about ten minutes and then be
permitted to fall somewhat below boiling point and kept at even heat for
a long time. The juices and flavors are thus retained.</p>

<p>It is not desirable that fish should be treated in this manner, as the
boiling water would break it into little pieces.</p>

<p>To stew meat, put small portions into cold water and raise temperature
slowly, until very hot, but not quite boiling. Let it remain thus for
some hours, and a rich broth, as well as juicy and tender meat, will
result.</p>

<p>In roasting meat it is well to remember that the smaller roast requires
the hotter fire. Intense heat produces a semi-solid condition of the
exterior, and prevents the drying up of the meat juices. Great heat
would be inapplicable to large cuts, the exterior of which would be
burned to a coal under such treatment before the heat could reach the
interior.</p>

<p>Young housekeepers and others who are not familiar with the various cuts
of meat obtainable in most of our markets will do well to consider
thoughtfully the accompanying illustrations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>In selecting beef we must remember that color is of great importance.
The surface of a fresh lean cut should be a bright red, while the fat
should be clear white. After being exposed to a warm atmosphere the
surface will of course become darker in color.</p>

<p>The loin commands a higher market price than any other cut, on account
of its tenderness and quality. The names applied to different parts of
the loin vary in different localities. The part nearest the ribs is
often called the "short steak," the other end the "sirloin."</p>

<p>It is interesting in this connection to recall the story which has been
told regarding the origin of the word "sirloin." It is said that this
steak found such favor with some epicurean king of olden times that he,
in a spirit of jocularity and good humor, bestowed upon it the honor of
knighthood, to the great delight of his assembled court, and as "Sir
Loin" it was thereafter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> known. It is a pity to spoil so good a story,
but the fact is that the word is derived from the French "sur" (upon)
and "longe" (loin), and the preferable orthography would therefore be
"surloin." However spelled, and whatever its history, the sirloin is
deservedly popular.</p>

<p>Between the short and sirloin is the portion usually called the
tenderloin, the name of which indicates its prevailing characteristic,
the tenderness which makes it a much-to-be-desired cut in spite of its
lack of juiciness and flavor as compared with other cuts.</p>

<p>The rib is the cut between the loin and chuck, and contains the best
roasts. The fat on the best grade of ribs should be about one-half inch
deep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Round steaks are rather popular, but as Americans have a preference for
loin and rib cuts, a large share of the lower grades of "rounds" are
used otherwise, being converted into Hamburger, used as sausage
trimmings and disposed of in many other ways.</p>

<p>Chucks are used extensively as shoulder steak, boiling pieces, and make
very good roasts. Pot roasts are cut from the lower side, and stews or
soup meat from the neck. The better grade of chucks should have a
complete covering of fat, thickest at the rib end of the cut.</p>

<p>Quality in veal is determined by color and grain of flesh. It should be
light pink, nearly white, and should contain a quantity of fat. The many
ways of cooking and serving veal are so well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> known as to need but
passing mention; veal loaf, veal cutlets, chops, pie, stew, curry of
veal and many others are all favorite dishes in many homes.</p>

<p>In selecting mutton or lamb we should be guided by color, fineness of
grain, thickness of flesh and amount of fat. Mutton of a dull brick red
is preferable, though the color varies from that to dark red. Lamb on
account of its superior flavor is more popular than mutton. The flesh of
lamb should be light in color, of fine grain and the fat evenly
distributed. The nutritive value of mutton and lamb is practically the
same as beef.</p>

FIG. 4.&mdash;Diagrams of cuts of pork.</span>
</div>

<p>The larger share of dressed pork is almost entirely clear fat, which
should be white, firm and evenly distributed. Skin should be thin and
smooth. Any detailed description of the various cuts of pork would be
superfluous here. Not all our eloquence could adequately picture the
delight with which an epicure gazes upon a ham boiled or baked by an
experienced Kentucky or Virginia cook. The "roasting pig" is also a
favorite in many places, and long has been, for, according to Irving, it
was much prized by Ichabod Crane of Sleepy Hollow, and it has been
mentioned by so great and learned a poet as Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Regarding all meats, we wish to say that as a rule the cheaper cuts have
as much food value as the more expensive ones. Careful cooking will
render the less expensive cuts delightfully appetizing. It is an
advantage to housekeepers to know that meat need not be the highest in
price to be nutritious and palatable.</p>

<h4>BAKED BREAST OF MUTTON.</h4>

<p>Sew up breast of mutton in a thin cloth, put into a stewpan, nearly
cover with cold salt water, and let simmer, allowing ten minutes to each
pound. Take out of pan and cloth, put into baking dish, rub over with
mutton drippings, butter or fat, sprinkle with flour and bake one-half
hour in hot oven, basting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> frequently with its own broth. Just before
removing from oven, strew with bread crumbs and butter and let brown.
Serve with brown sauce made from broth in which meat was cooked.</p>

<h4>BEEF OMELET.</h4>

<p>Three pounds chopped steak, three eggs, one and one-half cup rolled
crackers, lump of butter size of a walnut, salt and pepper to taste,
one-half cup milk. Mix thoroughly, make out in rolls, wrap in cloth, and
bake two hours.</p>

<h4>BEEFSTEAK WITH OYSTER BLANKET.</h4>

<p>Broil an inch-thick sirloin steak, remove to platter, spread with
butter, sprinkle with salt and pepper; cover steak with one pint of
oysters, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dot with butter, place on grate
in hot oven until the oysters are plump.</p>

<h4>BEEF TENDERLOIN.</h4>

<p>Take tenderloin of beef and lard it with pork. Put one can of mushrooms
with the beef and cook in oven twenty minutes. Then cut the meat in
slices one and one-half inch thick. On top of each slice place a few of
the mushrooms and a little of the gravy, and set back in the oven five
minutes to keep hot. Serve the slices on a chop plate, forming a circle,
and filling in the center with peas.</p>

<h4>BLANKETED HAM WITH SWEET POTATOES AND APPLES.</h4>

<p>Cut off the fat close to the edge of a slice of ham one-half inch thick.
Put fat through meat chopper, spread on top of ham, then sprinkle
one-half cup of brown sugar and wine-glass of sherry over it. Peel and
quarter four large sweet potatoes and four large apples. Put ham in oven
in covered roasting pan. After it has cooked a quarter of an hour add
apples and sweet potatoes. Now cook all of it three-quarters of an hour.
This makes a delicious and savory dish, and is so substantial that
little else is required for a meal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<h4>BROWN STEW.</h4>

<p>Thirty-five-cent beef off the shoulder; cut in pieces, cover with water
and stew two hours until tender. Add one tablespoonful butter, and
thicken with flour. Cook until brown.</p>

<h4>CHICKEN CROQUETTE.</h4>

<p>One-half pound chicken or veal, chopped very fine; season with one-half
teaspoonful salt, one-half teaspoonful celery salt, one-fourth
teaspoonful onion juice, one teaspoonful chopped parsley, one
teaspoonful lemon juice, one saltspoonful white pepper, one-fourth
saltspoonful cayenne. Mix with enough cream sauce to be easily handled;
let cool, then shape into rolls. Roll on fine bread crumbs, dip in
beaten egg, then roll in bread crumbs and fry in smoking-hot fat, drain
on tissue paper. Boil meat in three quarts hot water, cold for soup,
season with one teaspoonful salt, four grains pepper.</p>

<h4>CHICKEN CROQUETTES.</h4>

<p>Two pair sweetbreads, boiled and chopped fine, one teacupful boiled
chicken chopped (use nothing but the white meat), one teacupful boiled
bread and milk, pretty stiff; one-half pound butter, salt and pepper to
taste, mold in shape, roll in cracker crumbs, beaten egg, and again in
cracker crumbs, and fry in boiling lard.</p>

<h4>Chicken Croquette Remarks.</h4>

<p>Prepare meat and seasoning first. Put flour in hot butter dry, two
tablespoonfuls cold water in the egg. Boil meat very slowly, until very
tender. Make a hole in the flour when pouring in any liquid. Drop bread
into hot fat, count forty slowly, until brown, fat then at proper heat.
Cut a large potato in the hot grease; it takes out impurities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<h4>CROQUETTES.</h4>

<p>Cold turkey, chicken, veal or lamb, chopped fine; add one-fourth as much
bread crumbs as meat; salt, pepper and herbs to taste; then to one cup
of the mixture one well-beaten egg. Make in small balls egg-shaped, and
fry in boiling lard.</p>

<h4>FRICATELLI.</h4>

<p>Chop raw fresh pork very fine, add salt and pepper and two small onions
chopped fine, half as much stale bread as there is meat, soaked until
soft, two eggs; mix all well together, make into oblong patties, and fry
as you would oysters or other patties. A nice breakfast dish. Serve with
sliced lemon.</p>

<h4>HAM TOAST.</h4>

<p>One-fourth pound of either boiled or fried ham; chop it fine, mix with
the yolks of two eggs well beaten; one tablespoonful butter, enough
cream or milk to make it soft, a little pepper; stir this over the fire
until it thickens, dip toast into hot salted water for just an instant,
spread with melted butter, then turn over the ham mixture. Dried beef
may be substituted, adding, if fancied, a little chopped onion or
parsley.</p>

<h4>HUNGARIAN GOULASH.</h4>

<p>Slice a peeled onion and cook it until brown in three tablespoonfuls of
fat tried out of salt pork; take out the onion and turn in one and
one-half pound lean uncooked veal cut into inch cubes. Stir and cook the
meat until slightly browned, then, rejecting the fat, if there be any in
the pan, place the meat in a casserole; add about a pint of broth or
boiling water, a teaspoonful pepper, cover the dish and set to cook in
the oven. In the meantime add more fat to the pan; when hot, brown in it
a dozen balls cut from pared potatoes and a dozen small onions; when the
onions are well browned, add to the casserole, and after the meat has
been cooking an hour, add a teaspoonful salt and the potatoes, and if
desired two tablespoonfuls flour mixed to a thin paste with cold water.
Let cook in all about two hours. Serve from the casserole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<h4>JELLIED VEAL.</h4>

<p>A knuckle of veal, with the bone chopped; cover it with cold water and
boil till the meat drops from the bone, pass the meat through a chopper;
let the liquor continue boiling, as there must not be too much when you
return it to the meat to cook a few minutes longer, adding pepper and
salt to taste. Before removing from the fire, add quickly one egg. It is
nice poured into individual molds.</p>

<h4>LAMB AND RICE.</h4>

<p>Cut lean lamb from the neck into small pieces. Put on in cold water and
bring to a boil. Simmer for one and a half or two hours. Put in salt as
desired soon after putting on to cook. When done add freshly boiled rice
and simmer till the rice has absorbed the seasoning from the meat.</p>

<h4>LIVER AND BACON.</h4>

<p>Fry bacon till crisp. Then dip liver in the flour and fry until brown on
both sides. Remove from skillet and cook in the skillet for a few
minutes a chopped onion and a bunch of parsley. Then put back the liver
and bacon, cover all with water and let simmer about one hour.</p>

<h4>MEAT SOUFFLE.</h4>

<p>Make one cup of cream sauce and season with chopped parsley and onion
juice. Stir one cup chopped meat (chicken, fresh tongue, veal or lamb)
into the sauce. When hot, add the beaten yolks of two eggs, cook one
minute, and then set away to cool. When cool, stir in the whites, beaten
stiff. Bake in a buttered dish about twenty minutes and serve
immediately. If for lunch, serve with a mushroom sauce.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<h4>MEAT STEW.</h4>

<p>Get five pounds of a cheap cut of beef. Cut into little pieces, taking
off the fat. Try out the fat, brown the meat in it, and when well
browned, cover with boiling water, boil five minutes, then cook in lower
temperature until the meat is done. During the last hour of cooking add
two-thirds cup of turnips and the same amount of carrots cut in small
cubes, one-half an onion chopped fine, salt and pepper. About fifteen
minutes before taking up put in four cups of potatoes cut in small
pieces. Use one-quarter cup of flour for thickening and put in dumplings
made as follows:</p>

<p>Mix and sift two cups flour, four teaspoonfuls baking powder, one-half
teaspoonful salt. Work in two teaspoonfuls butter, add gradually
two-thirds cup milk. Roll to one-half inch thick, and cut out with
biscuit cutter.</p>

<h4>POT ROAST.</h4>

<p>Thirty-five-cent beef off the shoulder. Sear all over in hot fat, cover
with water, add two cloves, one onion, one bay leaf, cover and cook
slowly two and one-half hours. For gravy, thicken the liquor with flour.</p>

<h4>POT ROAST. (Old Style.)</h4>

<p>Take a piece of fresh beef, about five or six pounds, not too fat. Put
into a pot with just enough water to cover it. Set over a <i>slow</i> fire
and let stew an hour, then add salt and pepper. Stew until tender,
putting in a little onion if liked. Let nearly all the water boil away.
When thoroughly tender take the meat out and pour the gravy in a bowl.
Put a large lump of butter in the pot, dredge the meat with flour and
return it to the pot to brown, turning it often to prevent burning. Skim
fat from gravy poured off of meat; pour gravy in with the meat and stir
in a large spoonful of flour; wet with a little water; let boil ten or
fifteen minutes and pour into gravy dish. Try sometimes cooking in this
way a piece of beef which has been placed in spiced pickle for two or
three days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<h4>RAGOUT OF BEEF.</h4>

<p>Cut two pounds of the upper round of beef into inch squares, dredge them
with salt and pepper and roll them in flour. Put into a saucepan some
butter and some drippings, or a little suet, and let it fry out, using
enough only to cover the bottom of the saucepan; when the grease is hot,
turn in the pieces of meat and let them cook until well browned on all
sides; watch and turn them as soon as browned, then draw the meat to one
side of the pan and add a tablespoonful of flour; let the flour brown,
and add a cupful of stock or water, and stir it until it comes to a
boiling point; then add a teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful
pepper, one-half teaspoonful kitchen bouquet, one carrot cut into
blocks, and one teaspoonful onion; cover the saucepan, and let it
simmer, not boil, for an hour. Serve a border of rice around the ragout.</p>

<h4>ROAST BEEF.</h4>

<p>Clean roast by wiping with a wet cloth. Place on a rack in oven, add
suet to baste with. Cook a six-pound round roast an hour and twenty
minutes; a three-rib roast one and one-half hour. Use no water.</p>

<h4>ROUND STEAK.</h4>

<p>Cover round steak with raw, chopped onions and bacon. Roll and tie. Put
into deep kettle, sear or brown. Cover with water and pot roast for two
hours. Boil down and thicken the gravy.</p>

<h4>SMOTHERED OR POT-ROASTED BEEF.</h4>

<p>Take four or five pounds of the middle of the rump, the flank or the
round. Wipe with a clean, wet cloth and sear all over by placing in a
hot frying pan and turning until all the surface is browned. Put it in a
kettle with one-half pint of water, and place it where it will keep just
below boiling point. Add just enough water now and then to keep meat
from burning. Have close-fitting cover to keep in the steam. Cook until
very tender. Serve hot or cold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<h4>SPANISH STEAK.</h4>

<p>Get round steak one and one-fourth inch thick. Cook the same as veal
cutlets, only instead of using soup stock use one cup strained tomato
juice and a little onion; a few mushrooms add to the flavor.</p>

<h4>TURKEY DRESSING.</h4>

<p>Cut crust off a loaf of bread, cut loaf in small bits, season with salt,
pepper, sage, tablespoonful melted butter; beat one egg, add cup of milk
and wet dressing.</p>

<h4>VEAL BIRD.</h4>

<p>Make a dressing of bread crumbs, melted butter, salt, pepper, and, if
desired, a little sage. Cut veal cutlets into pieces about the size of
palm of hand. Put a spoonful of dressing into each piece, roll, and
fasten with a toothpick. Put in a pan with a cup of hot water or stock,
cover and bake. Arrange around a platter or chop plate. Fill center with
a pound of peas. This is delicious cooked in a fireless cooker.</p>

<h4>VEAL CUTLETS.</h4>

<p>Get a thick cutlet, one and a half inch thick, second cut with little
round bone; have it scored on both sides. Then chop it all over on both
sides with the edge of a china plate, until the meat is very ragged.
Salt and pepper it, and rub flour into both sides until it will hold no
more. Put two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter in a skillet and when hot
put in the cutlet. Brown on both sides a golden brown, then add one cup
of soup stock, or one cup boiling water, pouring it into the skillet.
Let simmer one hour.</p>

<h4>VEAL LOAF.</h4>

<p>Three pounds of raw veal chopped very fine, butter size of an egg, three
eggs, three tablespoonfuls cream or milk. Mix the eggs and cream
together. Mix with the veal four pounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> crackers, one teaspoonful
black pepper, one large tablespoonful salt, one large teaspoonful sage.
Mix well together and form into a loaf. Bake two and one-half hours,
basting with butter and water while baking. Serve cut in thin slices.</p>

<h4>VEAL LOAF.</h4>

<p>Three pounds of veal chopped fine, one-half pound salt or fresh pork,
one cup powdered crackers, one cup water, two eggs, three teaspoonfuls
salt, three teaspoonfuls sage, one teaspoonful pepper. Bake in rather
quick oven.</p>

<h4>VEAL PIE.</h4>

<p>Crust for veal or chicken pie, two teacups flour, two teaspoonfuls
baking powder, one teaspoonful salt, two tablespoonfuls shortening; beat
one egg and fill the teacup with milk, add to flour. Boil veal in cold
water until quite tender, keep out a quart of the broth after it is
cooked. When two-thirds done put in the salt.</p>

<h4>Gravy for Pie.</h4>

<p>Two tablespoonfuls melted butter, three tablespoonfuls flour; mix well,
add salt and pepper, one cup cream, slightly warm; stir in the quart of
broth after thickening is added. Cook about fifteen minutes, stir, but
do not boil. Put meat and gravy in baking dish, cover with dough and
bake twenty minutes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="EGGS" id="EGGS"></a>EGGS</h2>

<p>Eggs should be kept in cool places. If a recipe calls for just the white
of an egg, the yolk may be kept from hardening by putting in a cup of
cold water. Eggs may be cooked soft in two ways: Pour boiling water over
the egg and cover them from five to ten minutes. Second method: Put eggs
into cold water, and when water bubbles they are cooked.</p>

<h4>BAKED EGGS.</h4>

<p>Twelve hard-boiled eggs, one-half pint cream, butter size of an egg, one
teaspoonful fine chopped parsley, one tablespoonful flour, salt and
pepper. Mix cream, butter, flour and parsley. Cook till thick. Slice
eggs, after each layer of eggs one of bread crumbs; cover with sauce,
then bread crumbs, and bake till brown.</p>

<h4>CHEESE OMELET.</h4>

<p>Four eggs, four tablespoonfuls cold water, one-fourth teaspoonful salt,
three level tablespoonfuls grated cheese, two level tablespoonfuls
melted butter. Put butter in saucepan, separate whites from yolks. For
omelet do not beat yolks too long, only until lemon color. To yolks add
water and salt. Beat whites and pour yolks over whites; fold and cut
with a spoon. <i>Do not beat.</i> Pour in saucepan, loosen with a knife
around edges, cook until it sets. Sprinkle grated cheese on top and put
in oven for two or three minutes. Serve very hot. Old English dairy
cheese is the best.</p>

<h4>EGG CUTLETS.</h4>

<p>Heaping tablespoonful of butter. When hot, stir in two heaping
tablespoonfuls flour, one-half pint of milk, and stir until smooth and
well cooked; chop three hard-boiled eggs, and stir in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> after taking from
the fire. Season with salt, pepper and one-half teaspoonful of onion
juice; also add parsley. Put away until cold, mold and roll in cracker
crumbs, and fry in abundance of hot fat. This may be used for meat
croquettes, substituting chopped meat, cooked, for eggs.</p>

<h4>EGGS SHIRRED IN TOMATOES.</h4>

<p>Cut circular pieces out from the stem end of round tomato and remove
part of the pulp. Season with salt and pepper; also with onion, juice
and parsley, if liked. Break an egg into each tomato and put in a slow
oven until each egg is set. Serve on hot buttered toast.</p>

<h4>POACHED EGGS.</h4>

<p>Partly fill a shallow pan with boiling water. Break eggs singly into a
saucer, sliding each as broken into the boiling water. Keep pan where
water will not quite boil. With a spoon baste the water over the yolk
until it is covered thinly with white. Remove each egg with a skimmer,
trim off ragged edges, and serve on buttered toast.</p>

<h4>SHIRRED EGGS.</h4>

<p>Shirred eggs are a pleasant change from the usual boiled eggs for
breakfast. Drop each egg carefully into a buttered ramikin, season with
pepper, salt and a small lump of butter. Set ramikin in a shallow pan
filled with water, place in moderate oven and cook until whites are
firm.</p>

<h4>SOFT BOILED, OR STEAMED EGGS.</h4>

<p>Put the desired number of eggs into a kettle and cover with boiling
water. Cover the kettle and let stand ten minutes. Drain off the water,
put eggs into a bowl, cover again with boiling water and send to the
table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="VEGETABLES" id="VEGETABLES"></a>VEGETABLES</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Perhaps if we could penetrate Nature's secrets we should find that
what we call weeds are more essential to the well-being of the
world than the most precious fruit or grain."&mdash;Hawthorne.</p></div>

<p>The simplest methods of cooking and serving vegetables are generally the
best. The most common method of cooking them is in boiling water. All
green vegetables, bulbs and tubers should be crisp and firm when put on
to cook, and should, of course, be thoroughly cleaned before being
cooked.</p>

<p>Almost all vegetables may be served in the form of salad. Our most
common green salad plant is lettuce; celery is next, but endive, chicory
and dandelion, with many others, may be used to advantage in this way,
and furnish pleasing variety to the menu.</p>

<p>Nearly all vegetables are good canned, and if care is taken in preparing
and canning, it is possible to have fresh-tasting fruits and vegetables
through all seasons.</p>

<p>Thorough sterilization is necessary in canning or preserving. In the
first place, use good jars. Glass jars will be found the most
satisfactory. Those with glass top and rubber ring held in place by a
wire spring are the cheapest in the long run, although the initial
expense may be somewhat high. Never use defective rubbers, as vegetables
often spoil after being sterilized, because of bad rubbers.</p>

<p>A clothes boiler makes a good container to use in sterilizing. A false
bottom made of wire netting cut to fit or strips of wood may be used, as
the jars will break if set flat on the bottom of the boiler.</p>

<p>Select vegetables that have not begun to harden or decay. Always can as
soon as possible after gathering. Some vegetables<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> are best cooked
before putting in jars; among these are beets, pumpkins and turnips, but
most of them may be packed while raw in jars and cooked as follows:</p>

<p>Pack jar full, adding salt as desired, fill with cold water to the top
of the jar. Put the rubber on the jar and place the glass top on, but do
not press down the spring at the side of the jar. Put as many jars in
the boiler as it will hold without crowding. Pour into the boiler enough
water (cold) to prevent it from going dry during the boiling. Put the
cover on the boiler and bring the water to a boil and keep it boiling
for an hour. (Hour and a half for half-gallon jars.) At the end of this
time remove the boiler cover, and let the steam escape. Press down the
spring on each jar, which clamps on the top, and no outside air can
enter.</p>

<p>On the next day raise the spring at the side of the jar and boil as on
the first day, clamping on the top as before at the end of operation.
Repeat this on the third day. All meats, fruits and vegetables are
sterilized on this principle.</p>

<p>Never subject jars to a draft of cold air when removing them from the
boiler, as this will be likely to crack them. If, after sterilization
seems complete, any jars spoil, increase the time of boiling.</p>

<h4>ASPARAGUS.</h4>

<p>Cut the tender part into short pieces. Cover with boiling water, and
boil until done. Season with salt and pepper, and serve with most of
juice; or, if preferred, serve with a cream dressing.</p>

<h4>BEETS.</h4>

<p>Wash the beets carefully without breaking the skin. Cover with boiling

<h4>APPLES.</h4>

<p>While most people prefer apples cooked in some form, they are very good
and wholesome when eaten raw. There are so many varieties of this fruit
that one finds flavors of almost all other fruits if one tastes a number
of different kinds of apples.</p>

<h4>BANANAS.</h4>

<p>This is a fruit which is delicious eaten in almost any form. It is
especially good frozen.</p>

<h4>CANTALOUPES.</h4>

<p>Cantaloupes should be kept on ice and served in halves, each half filled
with chopped ice or peaches, as a breakfast dish. To clean cantaloupes,
scrape out seeds and wash out each half under the cold-water faucet. The
half may be filled with ice cream and served as a dessert.</p>

<h4>GRAPES.</h4>

<p>Put bunches in a colander and pour cold water over them. Drain and
chill, and arrange prettily on dish. Always be sure to remove the
imperfect grapes.</p>

<h4>GRAPE FRUIT.</h4>

<h4>(Shaddock.)</h4>

<p>This fruit was named for Captain Shaddock, who first brought it from the
East Indies. It is delicious, and supposed to have medicinal value. It
is refreshing served for breakfast,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> but may be used as first course for
any meal. It should be prepared several hours before needed. Cut in
half, remove center pulp with scissors or sharp, small knife; cut each
section away from pulp, put two tablespoonfuls powdered sugar and a
Maraschino cherry in center of each half. Place in cool place till ready
to serve.</p>

<h4>ORANGES.</h4>

<p>Oranges are the most delightful eaten raw, but there are many other ways
of serving them, the Seville orange being the most preferable for
cooking, and is a little bitter. A simple way of preparing them for a
dessert is to peel the oranges so as to remove outer layer of pulp, then
remove each section from pulp. Put alternately into dessert dish a layer
of oranges sprinkled with powdered sugar and a layer of shredded
cocoanut. Place in cool place and serve.</p>

<h4>PEACHES AND PEARS.</h4>

<p>These fruits have the high esteem of many people in warm and temperate
climates. The peach is called the Persian apple, and is, like the pear,
delicious served either cooked or raw.</p>

<h4>STRAWBERRIES.</h4>

<p>These are best served raw, and may be hulled, or if cream is not
desired, serve with the hulls left on and put a mound of powdered sugar
in the center of the fruit dishes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>Wash apples, remove blossom and stem ends, put them whole into a
porcelain-lined preserving kettle, add cold water to nearly cover
apples, cover and cook slowly until soft. Mash and drain through

apples. Now allow juice to drip through a jelly bag or through two
thicknesses of cheese-cloth, boil twenty minutes and add equal quantity
of sugar, boil five minutes, skim and turn in glasses. Let the glasses
stand in a sunny window twenty-four hours. A sprig of rose geranium

well-greased gem pans forty-five minutes. Baste with drippings.</p>

<h4>HELPFUL HINTS</h4>

<p>Dredge your cake tins with flour and your cake will not stick to the
pan.</p>

<p>Wooden spoons are the best to use when making cakes.</p>

<p>A little butter added to cake frosting greatly improves it.</p>

<p>Moisten grease spots with cold water and soda before scrubbing, as it
lightens the task.</p>

<p>To polish hardwood floors, use equal parts of vinegar, turpentine and
olive oil, thoroughly mixed: Rub in and polish with soft cloth.</p>

<p>To remove mildew stains, cover spots with lemon juice and salt and let
dry in the sun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Place a piece of wax paper over a knife when cutting butter.</p>

<p>If raisins and currants are rolled in flour before putting in a cake,
they will not sink to the bottom.</p>

<p>When cutting fresh bread, have the knife very hot.</p>

<p>Put a pinch of salt in the whites of eggs to make them whip better.</p>

<p>Stains on knives, however obstinate, will disappear if rubbed with a
piece of raw potato.</p>

<p>Put a slice of potato in the deep fat when frying doughnuts.</p>

<p>If potatoes are pared and laid in cold water just before boiling, they
will be much whiter.</p>

<p>Rice will absorb three times its measure of water and a large quantity
of milk or stock.</p>

<p>One ounce of butter equals two level tablespoonfuls.</p>

<p>One ounce of flour equals four tablespoonfuls.</p>

<p>Allow two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder to each cup of flour when
no eggs are used.</p>

<h4>A USEFUL TABLE.</h4>

<p>Three teaspoonfuls equal one tablespoonful.</p>

<p>Four tablespoonfuls equal a quarter cup.</p>

<p>One cup of butter or sugar equals one-half pound.</p>

<p>Two cups of flour equals one-half pound.</p>

<p>One rounded tablespoonful of butter, one ounce.</p>

<p>One quart sifted pastry flour equals one pound.</p>

<p>One pint of granulated sugar equals one pound.</p>

<p>One pint of butter equals one pound.</p>

<p>One pint of ordinary liquid, one pound.</p>

<h4>PROPORTIONS.</h4>

<p>One teaspoonful baking powder to one cup flour.</p>

<p>One teaspoonful cream of tartar and one-half teaspoonful soda to two
cups flour.</p>

<p>A little over an ounce of gelatine to a quart of liquid.</p>

<h4>MILK.</h4>

<p>Sour milk is used to raise doughs and batters, by adding to one pint
solidly sour milk one teaspoonful soda. Mixtures which contain molasses
require more soda.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

</p>

<h4>CHOCOLATE.</h4>

<p>Use one and one-half squares of bitter chocolate, one-fourth cup sugar,
three cups milk, one cup boiling water and a few grains of salt. Scald
the milk. Melt the chocolate in small saucepan, place over hot water,
add sugar, salt, and gradually the boiling water. When smooth, place on
the fire and boil for one minute; add to scalded milk, mill, and serve
in chocolate cups with whipped cream. One and one-half ounces of vanilla
chocolate may be substituted for the bitter; as it is sweetened, less
sugar is needed.</p>

<h4>CHOCOLATE.</h4>

<p>German chocolate, three sticks in a boiler; let melt. Add one pint hot
milk, let boil, then stir it for five minutes. Serve with whipped cream
on top. Melt in double boiler.</p>

<h4>COCOA.</h4>

<p>One and one-half tablespoonfuls prepared cocoa, two tablespoonfuls
sugar, two cups boiling water, two cups milk, and very little salt.
Scald milk. Mix cocoa, sugar and salt, dilute with one-half cup boiling
water to make smooth paste, add remaining water, and boil one minute;
turn into scalded milk and beat two minutes with Dover egg beater until
frothy.</p>

<h4>COFFEE.</h4>

<p>Use one tablespoonful of coffee to a cup, and one for the pot. Moisten
with cold water and mix well with the white of egg. Make with boiling
water and boil five minutes. Then let it stand in a hot place ten
minutes. Do not simmer&mdash;merely keep hot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<h4>COFFEE.</h4>

<p>One cup ground coffee, seven cups cold water, one-fourth an egg. Scald
granite-ware pot, dilute the egg with one-half cup of the cold water,
stir into the coffee and mix thoroughly. Add the rest of the water and
bring to a boil slowly. Remove to back of stove, add one tablespoonful
of cold water, and allow it to stand a few minutes.</p>

<h4>COMMITTEE JULEP.</h4>

<p>Five lemons, two oranges, two cups water, one bunch fresh mint, three
bottles ginger ale, one and one-half cup sugar; ice. Squeeze the juice
from lemons and oranges, add leaves from mint, sugar and water. Let
stand thirty minutes, add a large piece of ice and ginger ale. Serve in
small glasses.</p>

<h4>GRAPE JUICE.</h4>

<p>Many people are not aware of the excellent qualities of this delightful
and refreshing beverage. It is soothing to the nerves and aids the
appetite. When prepared according to the recipe given below it makes a
delicious and wholesome drink for persons in robust health, and in
addition to this will prove beneficial to those of frail constitutions.</p>

<p>Stem grapes and put them into a kettle with enough water to show. Heat
slowly, until grapes are soft enough to mash. Put them in a cheese-cloth
bag, and when cool enough, press till every drop of juice is extracted.
To two quarts of juice add one cup of sugar; heat and stir until sugar
is thoroughly dissolved. Bottle, cork and seal. When serving this drink,
dilute with water according to taste.</p>

<h4>TEA.</h4>

<p>Scald an earthen or china teapot. Use a teaspoonful of tea for each
person and one for the pot. Put into the pot and pour in freshly boiled
water, a cupful to each spoonful of tea. <i>Never boil tea</i>, but let it
stand in a warm place a few minutes before serving. Serve with or
without milk and sugar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>Tea and coffee, like all stimulants, should be used only in moderation.
The use of either by children or dyspeptics is not to be recommended.
Pure water is the best drink ordinarily for everybody. Most people
prefer cold water, as it is not so insipid as boiled, but a cup of hot
water taken in the morning on arising and one at night just before
retiring will prove of benefit to sufferers from dyspepsia or
indigestion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE FIRELESS COOKER.</h4>

<p>The idea of the fireless cooker is an old one, bringing things to a
boil, placing into a box of hay and leaving for a few hours to
cook&mdash;that method has been used by housewives in some European nations
for a good many years.</p>

<p>The cooker is, of course, made upon the same principle as that almost
indispensable article, the refrigerator. Instead of retaining the cold
and keeping out the heat, the fireless cooker does the opposite by
keeping food which has been brought to a boiling point at a temperature
high enough to continue the process of cooking for many hours.</p>

<p>Every one has wrapped up ice in a newspaper or carpet to keep it from
melting. In making the fireless cooker the material used for packing
around the boiling food is paper, hay, wool or cork, because any one of
these things is a poor conductor of heat&mdash;that is, the heat can not go
through them easily. Though there are many makes of fireless cookers on
the market, a home-made one will serve the purpose just as well, and for
the convenience afforded requires a comparatively small amount of time
and material.</p>

<h4>A HOME-MADE FIRELESS COOKER.</h4>

<p>Materials required: A box or barrel, one pair of strong hinges, a hasp,
material for stuffing, one or more large pails, one or more small pails
or pans, muslin&mdash;1&frac12; yard or more, depending on size of box; a cooking
thermometer, heavy pasteboard, brown paper, tacks and screws.</p>

<p>The box selected may be an unpainted one, to be had from most any store
for a few pennies, but the boards should be heavy enough to put on
hinges and a hasp. It should be four or five inches larger than the
kettle it is to contain. The easiest stuffings to procure are hay,
excelsior, or paper; among others which should be covered to keep them
in place are wool, mineral wool, cork, sawdust and cotton. If hay is
used, it should be soft.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>The best shape for the cooking utensil is a pail about the depth of its
own diameter; the sides should be straight and perpendicular to the
bottom, and the cover should fit securely in place. A smaller utensil
may be used inside the larger one; a pudding pan serves the purpose,
resting on the rim of the pail. Care should always be taken to have
covers that fit snugly on any pans that are used in the cooker. Aluminum
ware makes the best utensil, though enameled ware or agate ware may be
used. A six-quart pail with a pan to fit inside of it is a good size for
the ordinary family.</p>

<p>It is best to line the box and cover with a thickness of heavy paper or
several thicknesses of newspaper; asbestos sheeting may be used instead
of paper. Now pack in the box a firm layer of packing material about
four inches deep, not less; this must raise the cooking pail to within
three to five inches of top of box. Place utensil in middle of space on
this layer and pack around it closely until level with top of the
kettle. When it is removed a hole will be left just large enough for it
to slip into again.</p>

<p>A cushion should be made to cover the kettle. If more than one kettle is
used a cushion should be made for each. The cushion must be thick enough
to fill the box when the kettle is in place. Cut two pieces of muslin or
denim the sizes of top of box and join with a strip which is four or
five inches wide; fill with same material used in packing the box. There
should always be a slight pressure when the lid is closed.</p>

<p>The box is now ready for cooking. If the whole space is not firmly
filled after considerable use, more stuffing should be added. If a
covering is wanted for the stuffing, the simplest thing to use is a
sheet of very heavy paper, at least one inch larger than the top of box;
draw a circle in center of it the size of the pail. From center of
circle cut with sharp scissors to edge, to strike it at intervals of
about 1&frac12; inch. Fit paper over top of packing so that circle will come
just over nest for pail. Place pail in nest and it will crease the paper
down at exactly the right place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Since it is very important for the food to be placed into the cooker
while it is still boiling, the box should be placed as near to the stove
as possible. Everything should be ready before the food is taken from
the fire; the cooker open and the cushion removed. The box must be kept
tightly closed from the time the food is put in until it is entirely
done. If it is necessary to open the box before appointed time, the
contents must be reheated to the boiling point before it is replaced.
Though the time necessary to cook the foods on the stove is very short,
they must be boiled until heated to the center. Thus the denser and
larger the food, the longer it will take to heat.</p>

<h4>THE ADVANTAGES OF THE FIRELESS COOKER.</h4>

<p>One of the advantages of the fireless cooker has been mentioned&mdash;the
small amount of cooking over a fire, which means a great saving of fuel
and attention. The housekeeper may put the food into the cooker and
forget about it until meal time comes, busying herself in the meantime
with other things, or perhaps leaving home. She knows that the food is
not being ruined by burning, and that it will come to the table with its
full flavor unimpaired.</p>

<p>The pails used in a fireless cooker are easier to clean than pans which
have had the food burned into them, and the kitchen is never made a
degree warmer by use of the cooker, which is certainly agreeable during
the hot summer weather, and even onions may be cooked without the odor
pervading the house.</p>

<p>Nearly all foods may be cooked in the fireless cooker except those which
have to be crisp or brown, though roast meat may be browned either
before placing in the cooker or when the process of cooking is nearly
finished. Cereals, one of the most wholesome foods known, are greatly
improved by use of the fireless cooker. The long cooking makes them more
digestible and gives them a flavor which they lack when cooked only
fifteen or twenty minutes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Any person having a fair idea of the general principles of cooking will
need very little instruction for the successful use of the fireless
cooker. The following recipes do not pretend to cover the wide variety
of food possible to fireless cookery, but only give an idea in the
preparation of a few simple dishes that might be used for most any meal.</p>

<h4>BEEF BROTH.</h4>

<p>Wash one pound of lean beef from the shoulder or round. Chop the meat
fine and remove pieces of fat; put meat into a pint of cold water with
one-fourth teaspoon of salt and let it soak in a cold place for an hour.
Place meat in a small cooker pan set over a large cooker pail of hot
(but not boiling) water; heat the broth until it registers 165 degrees
Fahrenheit. Slip pails into cooker for half an hour. Strain through
coarse wire strainer, remove fat and serve at once in a heated cup. It
may be chilled or frozen to the consistency of mush.</p>

<h4>ROLLED OATS.</h4>

<p>Remove any husks or pieces from one cup of rolled oats. Put two and a
half cups of water, one teaspoon of salt and oats into a pan that fits
into a cooker pail. Boil until slightly thickened, stirring frequently;
put pan over a cooker pail of boiling water and put into a cooker for
from four to twelve hours. This is the ideal way to prepare rolled oats,
as it is almost impossible to cook it too long.</p>

<h4>BOILED POTATOES.</h4>

<p>Scrub potatoes with a small brush. Pare them and let them stand a while
in cold water. Cook them in a large amount of boiling salted water in a
cooker pail. When they have boiled one minute put them in the cooker for
from one and a half to three hours. New potatoes will not require so
long to cook as old.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<h4>BOILED FISH.</h4>

<p>Put a three-pound fish or three pounds of small fish into four quarts of
boiling water to which four teaspoonfuls of salt have been added; set it
at once into a cooker for one hour.</p>

<h4>POT ROAST.</h4>

<p>Have the butcher bone and roll three pounds of beef rump; dredge it well
with salt, pepper and flour and brown it on all sides in a frying pan
with a little of the fat from the meat. Put the meat, three cups of
boiling water, one bay leaf, one small onion, salt and pepper, two small
carrots, two sprigs parsley, one-half teaspoon celery seed, a little
flour, one-half teaspoon Worcestershire sauce into a small cooker pail
and let it simmer thirty minutes; set in a large pail of boiling water
and put into a cooker for nine hours or more. Reheat it to boiling
point; strain; thicken the liquor for gravy.</p>

<h4>RICE PUDDING.</h4>

<p>Heat one quart of milk, one teaspoonful of butter, one-third cup of
rice, one-eighth teaspoon of grated nutmeg, one-eighth teaspoon of salt
and one-half cup of sugar in a pudding pan over a cooker pail of water.
When water boils remove pan and bring pudding also to a boil. When
boiling, replace pudding in large pan of boiling water, cover and put
into cooker for three or four hours. One-half cup of small unbroken
seeded raisins may be added to this recipe, and the pudding may be
browned in oven before serving, if desired.</p>

<h4>STEWED CHICKEN.</h4>

<p>Clean and cut up a chicken. Put it, with the giblets, in enough boiling
salted water to cover it&mdash;one teaspoonful of salt to each quart of
water. Let it boil for ten minutes and put it into a cooker for ten
hours or more. If not quite tender, bring it again to a boil and cook it
for six or eight hours, depending on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> its toughness. Skim off as much
fat from the liquor as possible, pour off some of the liquor to use as
soup or stock, and thicken the remainder with flour for gravy. A beaten
egg or two stirred into the gravy just before serving improves it. Add
pepper and salt to taste, and serve chicken on hot platter with gravy
poured around it.</p>

<h4>SETTING THE TABLE.</h4>

<p>A most important thing necessary to the enjoyment of life, and an actual
aid to digestion and the preservation of health, is that each person
should make up his or her mind to forget all but pleasant thoughts and
to put an absolute bar against the discussion of disagreeable subjects
while at the table. Then only can they appreciate the fact that the meal
has been carefully prepared and the table daintily set.</p>

<p>To cook an excellent meal and then serve it well makes the meal perfect.
First of all the table linen should be immaculate. The more inexpensive
linens are as attractive as the handsomest damasks when absolutely
spotless and snowy white. For the lighter meals, breakfast and luncheon,
a center piece and doilies may be used instead of the table cloth. The
silver should be polished frequently and glasses wiped out carefully
before placing on the table. A small fern or low bowl filled with
short-stemmed flowers in the center of the table gives a dainty, cozy
air, while the more elaborate vases may be used on more formal
occasions. Four shaded candles on the table, when there are side lights
in the dining room, cast a soft and pleasing light, far more agreeable
to the eyes than the usual chandelier.</p>

<p>The placing of the silver must, of course, suit the character of the
meal. If the meal is simple, the service should be simple. A good
arrangement for an ordinary dinner is to place the fork and teaspoon at
left of space allowed for plate, the knife and butter knife at the
right, the napkin on right side and coffee spoon at the top, with water
glass at the right and butter plate at left of each place. Various
articles may be added, such as oyster fork, bouillon spoon, salad fork
and so forth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<h4>FOOD FOR, AND SERVING THE SICK.</h4>

<p>The utmost care should be taken in cooking food for the invalid, so that
all of the flavor and delicacy of each dish may be preserved. We take it
for granted that the food is the best that can be had, and that absolute
cleanliness is used in preparation. But, really, the important thing is
to make the tray as attractive and dainty as possible, or the food will
not be tempting, no matter how carefully prepared.</p>

<p>The tray should have a fresh, white cover each time it is carried to the
sick room, and thin china of a pretty pattern should be used. In the
summer time any garden flower, laid on the fresh napkin beside the
plate, lends a cheerful note of color to the tray. Always serve small
portions, as a large helping does not look appetizing to sick, tired
eyes, and be careful in serving liquids not to spill any on the tray
cloth or saucer.</p>

<p>It is those little things that sometimes disgust the invalid with what
is put before him. There is a tidy and an untidy way of serving most
dishes, too; for instance, in serving a poached egg, have it piping hot
and on the toast; not cold, part on the toast and part on the saucer,
with the yolk broken.</p>

<p>So each detail should be carried out, and you will find your care and
attention rewarded by the invalid's interest in the tray, with its
tinkling china and savory dishes.</p>

<p>Invalids should have graham bread, and must not be permitted to eat
bread less than twenty-four hours old. Toast is a very good thing for
most sick people, and should be browned very slowly in order that it may
be dried through. It is then partially digested. It is best eaten dry.</p>

<p>Broths and soups are much used; oyster soup may be given, as well as
gruel made of oatmeal or barley. Soups made of vegetables must be
strained and served according to the doctor's orders.</p>

<p>Scraped beef is very nutritious, and is served raw between slices of
bread and butter. Baked and broiled fish are nice, and generally
relished by sick people.</p>

<p>Soft boiled and scrambled eggs are quite safe to give, as a rule.</p>

<p>If potatoes are liked, have them baked. Other vegetables may be given,
but it is always best to consult the physician before serving things
about which one is doubtful. Food that will not be harmful in some cases
may be decidedly so in others. Generally, it is best to avoid fried and
warmed-over meats, and pork should not be served to the sick.</p>

<p>Avoid unripe or overripe fruit. In serving oranges, remove the tough
part and give only the juice. Baked and stewed apples are to be
recommended; sometimes baked custard, and rice or other puddings. If any
stewed berries are to be used, be sure to strain them.</p>

<p>Coffee is good to use moderately in malarial troubles, and tea, not very
strong, may be used sparingly when the heart is not affected. Milk, when
it agrees with the patient, may be given. Lemonade and lemon water ice
are very refreshing and will often be taken when other drinks do not
seem tempting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
